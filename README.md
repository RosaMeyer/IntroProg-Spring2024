# Introduction to Programming and Numerical Analysis Spring 2024

## Classes 4 and 8

Welcome to Introduction to Programming and Numerical Analysis!

This repository contains material for the exercise classes 4 and 8. I'll upload my own slides/material and other material relevant to classes here.

You can find the rest of the course material in these repositories:

- [Lectures](https://github.com/NumEconCopenhagen/IntroProg-lectures) 

- [Exercises](https://github.com/NumEconCopenhagen/IntroProg-exercises)

Check out the [course website](https://sites.google.com/view/numeconcph-introprog/home) for installation guides, deadlines, and other relevant information.

Please feel free to email me at *jdc334@alumni.ku.dk* with any questions or uncertainties you might have in relation to the content of the course. I won't always be able to provide a quick response, but I'll do my best to answer as fast as possible!
